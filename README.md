Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is writing codes into computer to help solve real world problems. it helps in building apps, websites and games.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1 software criss- its where software development was recognised as principle for engineering.
2 Raise of object oriented programming - it led to more organized and maintainable codes. 
3 Internet age and agile methodologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
Planning: Define goals, requirements.
Design: Analyze, create architecture. Coding: Write the software.- Testing: Find and fix bugs.
Deployment: Release the software.-Maintenance: Support and updates


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:Process: Linear, sequential.Change: Difficult, costly.Requirements: Fixed, well-defined.Best for: Stable projects, strict regulations.
Example: Medical device software.
Agile:Process: Iterative, incremental.Change: Embraces change.Requirements: Evolving, unclear.Best for: Flexible projects, rapid releases.
Example: Web application development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
